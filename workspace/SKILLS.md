# SKILLS.md - Available Skills

Skills extend your capabilities with tools. Each skill has its own `SKILL.md` in the `skills/` directory.
Read the relevant `SKILL.md` before using a skill — it tells you how to invoke it and what it expects.

## Installed Skills

<!-- List your skills here as they are added, e.g.: -->
<!-- - **browser** — Web browsing and screenshot capture → `skills/browser/SKILL.md` -->
<!-- - **camera** → `skills/camera/SKILL.md` -->

No skills installed yet.

## How to Use a Skill

1. Check this file to see if the skill exists
2. Read its `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for usage instructions
3. Note any environment-specific details in `TOOLS.md` (device names, endpoints, etc.)

## Adding a Skill

Drop the skill directory under `skills/` and add an entry above.
Update `TOOLS.md` with any local configuration the skill needs.
